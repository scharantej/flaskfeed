 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a newsfeed app. The app should allow users to view a list of news articles and read the full text of each article. The app should also allow users to search for news articles by keyword.

## Design

The app will be built using the Flask microframework. The following HTML files will be needed for the application:

* `index.html`: This file will be the main page of the app. It will display a list of news articles.
* `article.html`: This file will display the full text of a single news article.
* `search.html`: This file will allow users to search for news articles by keyword.

The following routes will be needed for the application:

* `/`: This route will render the `index.html` file.
* `/article/<int:article_id>`: This route will render the `article.html` file, passing in the ID of the news article to be displayed.
* `/search`: This route will render the `search.html` file.

The following code shows the Flask application code:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    articles = [
        {'title': 'Article 1', 'content': 'This is the content of article 1.'},
        {'title': 'Article 2', 'content': 'This is the content of article 2.'},
        {'title': 'Article 3', 'content': 'This is the content of article 3.'}
    ]
    return render_template('index.html', articles=articles)

@app.route('/article/<int:article_id>')
def article(article_id):
    article = {
        'title': 'Article 1',
        'content': 'This is the content of article 1.'
    }
    return render_template('article.html', article=article)

@app.route('/search')
def search():
    return render_template('search.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Testing

The app can be tested by running the following command:

```
python app.py
```

The app can then be accessed by visiting the following URL:

```
http://localhost:5000
```
